Still very much work in progress!

- Start Rstudio on the linux rekenserver desktop (currently web interface raises an error, and I don't know why)
- Open the 'app.R' file (and make sure the 'WJlib.r' file is in the same folder.
- Run the app via the 'Run app' button in the screen.
- You might have to locally intall some of the packages that are needed.
- By default the file 'combined_data.csv' is loaded.
- The app will load  a list of any .csv or .rda files that are present in the main folder or from ../data_files if that is present.
- Now also reads MyM files!
- Other files can be loaded via the upload functionality in the presets.
- It should be quite flexibel in what it can handle, let me know you have issues.
- The program might crash if you make weird selections, but usually it will simply reload upon a new selection.

To do:
MyM read capability
Making sure the saved figures look the same as displayed ones (not always the case)
Saving and updating settings to be able to reproduce graphs
Etc.
